# 🎨 Sentiment-Based Country Coloring Update

## Overview
Updated the globe to show sentiment-based coloring for countries instead of city-level news. Countries are now colored based on their news activity level, with no need for clicking to change colors.

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Structure Simplified ✅
**Before:**
```javascript
{
  id: 1, 
  name: "United States", 
  lat: 37.0902, 
  lon: -95.7129,
  cities: [
    { name: "New York", lat: 40.7128, lon: -74.0060, newsCount: 15 },
    { name: "Los Angeles", lat: 34.0522, lon: -118.2437, newsCount: 8 },
  ]
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
{
  id: 1, 
  name: "United States", 
  lat: 37.0902, 
  lon: -95.7129, 
  newsCount: 45, 
  sentiment: "high"
}
```

### 2. Country Sentiment Levels
Countries are now assigned sentiment levels based on their news activity:

| Country | News Count | Sentiment | Color |
|---------|------------|-----------|-------|
| China | 67 | very-high | 🔴 Red |
| India | 52 | very-high | 🔴 Red |
| United States | 45 | high | 🟠 Orange |
| Russia | 38 | high | 🟠 Orange |
| France | 35 | high | 🟠 Orange |
| United Kingdom | 32 | medium-high | 🟡 Yellow |
| Germany | 29 | medium-high | 🟡 Yellow |
| Japan | 28 | medium-high | 🟡 Yellow |
| Brazil | 23 | medium | 🟢 Light Green |
| Canada | 21 | medium | 🟢 Light Green |
| Australia | 18 | medium | 🟢 Light Green |
| South Africa | 14 | low-medium | 🟢 Green |

### 3. Color Mapping System
The `getNewsColor()` function maps news counts to colors:

```javascript
const getNewsColor = (newsCount) => {
  if (newsCount > 20) return '#ff1144';  // 🔴 Red: Very High
  if (newsCount > 15) return '#ff6600';  // 🟠 Orange: High
  if (newsCount > 10) return '#ffdd00';  // 🟡 Yellow: Medium
  if (newsCount > 5) return '#44ff88';   // 🟢 Light Green: Low-Medium
  return '#00ff66';                      // 🟢 Green: Low
};
```

### 4. Removed Features
- ❌ City markers (no longer displayed on globe)
- ❌ City data arrays in country objects
- ❌ `selectedCity` state variable
- ❌ `handleCityClick` function
- ❌ City listings in news panel
- ❌ `onCityClick` prop in RealisticEarth component

### 5. Updated CountryMarker Component
**Key Changes:**
- Markers now use **sentiment-based colors** instead of selection-based (cyan/pink)
- Color is determined by `getNewsColor(country.newsCount)`
- Marker color is **static** and reflects the country's news activity level
- Clicking still opens the info panel but doesn't change the marker color

**Code:**
```javascript
const color = getNewsColor(country.newsCount);
// Applied to both sphere and ring materials
```

### 6. Enhanced News Panel
The right-side panel now shows:
- ✅ Country name and location
- ✅ News count with large, prominent display
- ✅ Activity level description (Very High, High, Medium, etc.)
- ✅ Color-coded sentiment indicator
- ✅ Progress bar showing activity level
- ✅ Sentiment label (high, medium-high, etc.)
- ✅ Geographic coordinates
- ✅ Explanatory text about the monitoring system

### 7. Added Color Legend
A new legend in the bottom-right corner shows:
- 🔴 Very High (>20)
- 🟠 High (15-20)
- 🟡 Medium (10-15)
- 🟢 Low-Medium (5-10)
- 🟢 Low (<5)

### 8. Updated UI Text
- Header: "Global News Sentiment Monitor"
- Subtitle: "Country colors reflect news activity levels"
- Controls: "View Details" instead of "Select"

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `Globe.jsx` - Main component
  - Updated `countriesData` array (12 countries)
  - Modified `CountryMarker` component
  - Removed city marker rendering
  - Simplified state management
  - Redesigned news panel

## Visual Features
- 🌍 **NASA Blue Marble Textures** - Realistic Earth imagery

## User Experience
1. **Globe loads** with all countries colored by sentiment
2. **User rotates/zooms** to explore different regions
3. **Click a country** to see detailed information in right panel
4. **Color legend** helps interpret the sentiment levels
5. **Panel shows** news count, activity level, and description
6. **Close panel** with ✕ button to return to overview

## Color Psychology
- **Red (#ff1144)**: High urgency, maximum news activity
- **Orange (#ff6600)**: Elevated activity, significant news
- **Yellow (#ffdd00)**: Moderate activity, steady news flow
- **Light Green (#44ff88)**: Lower activity, routine news
- **Green (#00ff66)**: Minimal activity, quiet period

## Benefits of This Approach
✅ **Instant Visual Feedback** - See all country sentiments at once
✅ **No Interaction Required** - Colors are always visible
✅ **Simplified UI** - Removed complex city-level navigation
✅ **Better Overview** - Easier to compare countries globally
✅ **Performance** - Fewer markers to render (12 countries vs 20+ cities)
